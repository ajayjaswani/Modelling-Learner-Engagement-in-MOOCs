1. No of videos palyed by the learner.
2. No of days the learner was active(measured in terms of the no of days user logged inn to the course).
3. Grade that the learner achieved in various assignments and quizzes.
4.  No of posts that the learner made on Discussion  Forums.
5. No of Chapters completed by the Learner.

### 1. Actively Engaged-
These are the Learners which remain very active throughout the course based upon the above mentioned parameters and in turn will complete the course.
